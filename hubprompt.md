# Prompt: Plan an MCP Hub Middleware (Cores + Hub)

You are an experienced distributed-systems architect. Using the docs in this folder — HUB_CONCEPT.md (concept + integration guide) and The_Hub/README.md — produce a phased architecture and delivery plan for a Hub that unifies multiple MCP "Core" servers behind one client connection.

Scope and constraints:
- Cores are standalone MCP servers (like the Action1 Core in this repo) that speak MCP over STDIO. The Hub should remain thin (transport, namespacing, routing, policy, observability). No business logic in the Hub.
- Target modernization: Node/Go/Rust are acceptable. Favor OpenTelemetry for telemetry, mTLS (SPIFFE/SPIRE) for identity, and a secret manager (Vault or cloud KMS). Avoid custom protocols when possible.
- The Hub must support local STDIO Cores and remote Cores (containers/SSH/WebSocket) with the same contract.

Deliverables (what your plan must include):
1) Architecture overview: diagrams and data-flow for Client ↔ Hub ↔ Cores. Include local/remote transport options.
2) Manifest and lifecycle: a schema for Core definitions (command/args/env/secrets/policy), hot-reload, readiness, and restart strategy with backoff.
3) Namespacing and routing: registry design for `<core>:<tool>`, conflict handling, discovery tool (`hub.list_tools`).
4) Policy & guardrails: per-core/tenant concurrency caps, rate limits, allow/deny lists, global destructive-op blocks, timeouts and cancellation semantics.
5) Secrets & identity: secret injection/rotation flow, redaction, workload identity (mTLS with SPIFFE), and audit expectations.
6) Reliability & resilience: retries (idempotent only), circuit breakers, bulkheads/queues, backpressure, adaptive throttling from 429s/headers.
7) Observability: OTel traces/metrics/logs, correlation IDs, exemplar usage, Prometheus scrape targets, dashboards and alerts.
8) Fan-out & aggregation: envelope format `{ core, tool, status, result }`, partial-failure semantics, and result-consistency notes.
9) Multi-tenancy: isolation strategies (process/container), namespace design (optional tenant prefix), per-tenant quotas.
10) Deployment & HA: stateless Hub, multiple replicas, config/secrets stores, optional mesh, recommended cloud infra.
11) Security hardening: sandboxing (seccomp/AppArmor), file/network policies, and incident runbooks.
12) Phased roadmap: P0→P3 milestones with acceptance criteria and risk register.
13) Repo layout: top-level structure for Hub code, config, docs, and examples. No code; just the plan and schemas.

Research inputs:
- Start with The_Hub/HUB_CONCEPT.md in this repo for a baseline.
- Incorporate current best practices: SPIFFE/SPIRE, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Envoy/Linkerd/Istio if applicable, NATS/Kafka where appropriate, OPA for policy.
- Assume many Cores of similar shape to the Action1 Core will be plugged in.

Output format:
- A single markdown plan with sections matching the deliverables, plus architecture diagrams (ASCII or mermaid), and a brief glossary.
- Keep it actionable, vendor-neutral where possible, and explicit about non-goals.

Do not implement code; produce a design and execution plan only.
