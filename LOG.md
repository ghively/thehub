# Hub Project Activity Log

This log documents incremental steps, changes, tests, and validation related to turning the concept docs into a barebones, testable runtime stub compatible with MCP and ChatGPT Connections.

## 2025-09-07

- Initialized local clone of `ghively/thehub`.
- Added deployment goals for Docker and ChatGPT Connections; emphasized transport-agnostic, single-manifest design.
- Created DOCKER.md with container and Connections guidance.
- Updated HUB_CONCEPT.md, MANIFEST_SPEC.md, CORE_INTERFACE.md, ROADMAP.md, SECURITY_MODEL.md, and OPERATIONS.md accordingly.
- Added ARCHITECTURE.md describing shared Tool Registry, multi-transport HubServer, session policies, and compliance.
- Added minimal runtime stub (Node.js): STDIO + WebSocket servers with a simple `echo.say` tool.
- Added Dockerfile for the stub.
- Wrote compliance reference docs: docs/mcp_requirements.md and docs/chatgpt_connections_requirements.md.

Planned next:
- Install dependencies; create and run STDIO + WebSocket tests.
- Validate results and iterate as needed.

Logging: install dependencies in runtime and run tests

- Ran STDIO test: passed. Preparing to run WS test with elevated permissions due to sandbox port binding restrictions.
- Ran WS test: passed under elevated permissions (sandbox restricts listen/connect).
- Outcome: Barebones runtime validates MCP handshake, tools/list, tools/call, and ping over STDIO and WS.
- Implemented manifest loader + core supervision and namespaced routing.
- Added echo-core and example manifest; created integration tests (STDIO/WS).
- Ran Hub-Core STDIO integration: passed.
- Hub-Core WS integration requires elevation due to sandbox port binding restrictions.
